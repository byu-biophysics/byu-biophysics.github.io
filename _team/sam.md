Sam is a junior majoring in biophysics with a double minor in computer science and math. His favorite part of being part of the BYU biophysics team is using computational methods and mathematics to model and solve problems at the intersection of physics and biology. After graduation, he plans to pursue a PhD in biophysics or bioengineering.

Sam grew up all around the world—he called five different countries home before he graduated from high school! Staying in one place does have some advantage, though—he is the proud owner of at least seven healthy houseplants.
