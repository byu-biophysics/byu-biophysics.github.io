Rachel is from Springville, Utah, and graduated from BYU with a BA in editing and publishing with a minor in chemistry. She is a scientific writer and editor for the Jensen lab and works as the communications specialist for the biophysics group. She’s passionate about making scientific material clear and accessible to the public, and she loves learning every day—whether it be related to chemistry, biology, or computer vision, she likes it all. 

When not working in the lab, Rachel enjoys reading a good book, hanging out with her husband, and eating ice cream.
