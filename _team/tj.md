TJ is studying applied and computational mathematics with a minor in physics, which helps him fit right in with the BYU biophysics group. He loves applying math and science to important problems in chemistry and biology, and he hopes to one day use his technical skills to develop products and services that will genuinely help people. So far, he’s used his expertise to help Dr. Dennis Della Corte (BYU physics professor) create a deep learning model capable of assigning a cancer grading system to pictures of prostate cancer. He also spent a summer working at Sandia National Labs, where he implemented a data augmentation for CNN classifiers used to identify SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images, as well as developed a method for aligning deterministic and highly variable 1D signals. 

When TJ’s not solving technical problems, you can find him hiking, playing racquetball (or any sport that requires a racquet or paddle, really), or carving wooden toys.
