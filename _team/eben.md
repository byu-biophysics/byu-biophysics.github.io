Eben is a junior from Marshfield, WI, studying physics with a math minor. He plans to go on to earn a PhD in medical physics, which he will use to enter the field of medical imaging or cancer modeling and treatment. His dedication to improve people’s lives drives his work in the biophysics group, which has the potential to improve the scientific community’s understanding of bacteria and viruses. He also enjoys the variety of perspectives in the group, valuing the opportunity to learn from his peers. 

Prior to joining the biophysics group, Eben worked with a City University of New York student on a project using neural networks to classify galaxies. One of Eben’s life goals is to have a room filled with books, and he’s currently working on building his personal library. If he’s not reading or working, he’s either playing the piano or doing something outside—snowboarding, running, rock climbing, and mountain biking, anything to be in nature.
