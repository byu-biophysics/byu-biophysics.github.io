From Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mati arrived in the United States just before his first semester with nothing but a backpack, $300, and his student visa. Growing up, Mati participated in international mathematics Olympiads and won international robotics competition, fueling his passion for math and computer science. At BYU, Mati is majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics, emphasizing in machine learning. He thrives in the biophysics group, where everyone is constantly sharing ideas, suggestions, and inspiration with each other to increase their knowledge and skills.

Mati’s ultimate goal is to develop his expertise in computer vision and contribute to medical research, eventually returning to Argentina to make meaningful impact in his home country. He’s determined to give it his all and make the most of every opportunity that presents itself.
