From Denver, Colorado, Nathan is a junior studying biochemistry. Officially part of the Jensen lab, his research is centered on understanding and imaging chemosensory arrays, commonly known as the “nose of the cell,” and he is valuable in the biophysics team for his tomogram labeling and annotation skills. Nathan wants to go on to earn his PhD/MD and focus on medical research that will help people in the future. 

When not studying for class or working in the lab, Nathan is swimming with the UV Rays or playing volleyball with his friends.
