From Frisco, Texas, Matthew is a junior studying applied and computational mathematics with an emphasis in data science and machine learning. He enjoys learning about computer vision and image processing, and tomograms from the Jensen lab make a perfect playing field for him. Eventually, Matthew hopes to find a permanent place in the machine learning community. Until then, you can find him relaxing and reading a book in Spanish or playing the cello in University Strings, the schoolâ€™s orchestra for non-music majors. s
